# Proyecto6Backend
In this project I have used express and Mongo Atlas using mongoose. I have created 3 models relating 2 collections, and set complete CRUD.

The steps I have followed are:
first configure the database.
Then I made the model, continuing through the controllers and ending with the routes of each collection.
